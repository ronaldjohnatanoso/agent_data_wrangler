### Professional Report on HR Data Analysis and Cleaning

#### Trends and Insights:
1. **Employee Age and Salary**: The dataset includes employees from various age groups, with salaries ranging broadly. The average age is around 36.6 years, and the average salary is approximately $74,746.
2. **Extreme Bonus Values**: Bonus percentages had extreme values ranging from -18.5% to 60%. These were adjusted to fall within a more typical range.
3. **Performance Scores**: The performance scores mostly range from 1 to 5, with an average score of about 3.45.
4. **Attrition**: The dataset includes a 'left_company' column indicating whether employees have left the company, which could be useful for attrition analysis.

#### Cleaning Steps Performed:
1. **Handling Missing Values**:
   - Filled missing values in 'age', 'salary', 'bonus_percent', and 'performance_score' using their respective median values.
   - Dropped rows with missing 'last_promo_date' values as these could be crucial for analysis.

2. **Handling Outliers**:
   - Identified and corrected extreme outliers in 'age', 'salary', 'bonus_percent', and 'performance_score' by replacing them with NaN and then imputing with median values.

#### Recommendations:
- Further analysis could focus on the impact of promotions on employee retention, given the importance of 'last_promo_date'.
- Consider analyzing the relationship between performance scores and bonuses to identify any potential biases.
