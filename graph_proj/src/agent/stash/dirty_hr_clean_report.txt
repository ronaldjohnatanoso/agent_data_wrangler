**Data Analysis and Cleaning Report**

**Trends and Insights:**
1. The dataset contains information about employees, including their age, department, salary, bonus percentage, and performance scores.
2. The distribution of ages shows a broad range, with a notable maximum age of 91, which could indicate data entry errors.
3. Bonus percentages also vary significantly, with some negative values suggesting possible data issues.
4. Performance scores are generally distributed between 1 and 5.

**Data Cleaning Steps Performed:**
1. Missing values were filled: 
   - 'age' was filled with the median value.
   - 'salary' was filled with the mean value.
   - 'last_promo_date' was filled with the mode value.
   - 'bonus_percent' was filled with the mean value.
   - 'performance_score' was filled with the median value.
2. Outliers beyond 3 standard deviations from the mean were removed for 'age', 'salary', and 'bonus_percent'.
3. Duplicate rows were checked, and none were found.

**Remaining Issues and Recommendations:**
1. The maximum age of 91 is an outlier and might need verification.
2. Negative bonus percentages should be reviewed for potential data entry errors.
3. Future analysis could involve investigating the relationship between performance scores and salary or bonuses to understand employee motivation better.
